2. Given the Inertial frame and body-fixed frame on a UAV with their axes initially aligned, where their z axes are pointing upward (opposite to the direction of the gravity), please find the attitude trajectory of the UAV (i.e., ) given the measurement of the accelerometer of SI unit stored in the excel file. The magnitude of the gravity is 9.8  pointing to -z axis of the inertial frame. (60%)(HW4-2.xls)
